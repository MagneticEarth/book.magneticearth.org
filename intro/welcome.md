:::{admonition} How to run the interactive elements
:class: note
Some of these pages are generated from Jupyter notebooks which can be interacted with on the [ESA Swarm Virtual Research Environment](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/tools/swarm-vre) - on those pages you will see a ðŸš€ rocket button at the top. Hover over that button and select *JupyterHub* to launch the notebook interactively (after first creating a free account).
